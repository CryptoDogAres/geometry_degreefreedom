    "Harmonic (the company behind Newclid) also has a Lean-based prover called Aristotle. The company provides a web interface and API at https://aristotle.harmonic.fun.

[ARISTOTLE]\n",

    "Harmonic reports that Aristotle achieved gold medal-level performance on the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), with formally verified solutions. [HN-IMO][BW-IMO] Those IMO announcements are a useful backdrop for this demo: we stay with a simple trapezoid ratio, but the tooling is designed for much harder proofs.\n",

    "Aristotle has also been used beyond contest problems. In late 2025, it produced a Lean proof of a simplified variant of Erdős Problem #124. Chinese coverage highlighted that the system completed a variant autonomously in about six hours, while other reports noted that the solved statement was easier than the original conjecture. [E124-6H]\n",

    "**Note on proof style.** In this problem Aristotle proceeds by coordinates model, so the proof is essentially algebraic and very similar to the essence of what we did in Part 2. However it should be pointed out that in other plane geometry problems it can use more geometric, angle-chasing reasoning. For example, in the Harmonic IMO 2025 P2 formalization [IMO2025P2], the proof structure reflects angle relations and cocyclic arguments rather than pure coordinate algebra. This highlights that Aristotle can deploy higher-level strategies beyond the coordinate approach used here.\n",
