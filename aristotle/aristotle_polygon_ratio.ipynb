    "Harmonic (the company behind Newclid) also has a Lean-based prover called Aristotle that's their closed source flagship product. The company provides a web interface and API at https://aristotle.harmonic.fun that anyone can register and try (caveat it is very slow with long queue for job requests). This note uses our small, friendly geometry problem to demonstrate the workflow, while the same system is aimed at harder, cutting-edge problems across mathematics (geometry, number theory, analysis, and more) [ARISTOTLE].\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Aristotle differs from Newclid (short version).** Newclid is a geometry-first system: you give a diagram-style construction and goals, and its symbolic engine tries to derive a synthetic proof inside that geometry domain. Aristotle is a general Lean prover: it formalizes statements in Lean and then proves them with Lean tactics, so its output is a formal Lean proof rather than a geometry-specific trace. For geometry problems, Aristotle's geometric solver can still use geometric reasoning (which appeared to be Newclid like), but in this demo it chooses a coordinate model, which looks closer to the analytic approach in Part 2. This is why the artifacts here feel more Lean/coordinate-heavy than Newclid's geometric narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Harmonic reports that Aristotle achieved gold medal-level performance on the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) solving 5 out of 6 problems, with formally verified solutions[HN-IMO][BW-IMO]. In the problem solved, problem 2 is about pure plane geometry [IMO2025P2]. It is vague if the solution adopted used Newclid approach, which Aristotle paper hinted that a separate solver is indeed used for geometry problems, following by the paper describing Newclid a month later. The proof also appears to be a geometry deduction instead of the Lean language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general those IMO announcements are a useful backdrop for this demo: we stay with our simple trapezoid ratio to show how aristotle solve such simple problems in geometry, but the tooling is designed for much harder proofs in various domain beyond geometry. Without the full knowledge on how Aristotle's geometric engine differs from the open sourced Newclid, we will focus on how the solution to our simple polygon problem differ between the two to give an observation in this part of the notes. In general the aforementioned white papers propose that Aristotle trained a LLM with reinforcement learning to handle highly parallel Monte Carlo Graph Search over Lean proof states, with policy/value network to pick tree nodes and estimate promise. This differs from the Newclid default BSF tree search, which is enhanced by auxiliary point helper when the search logic stuck. This part of the design is beyond the scope of the current discussion. For our simple problem Aristotle indeed gives a distinct solution repying on Lean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aristotle has been aimed and used beyond contest problems. In late 2025, it produced a Lean proof of a simplified variant of Erdos Problem 124. Chinese coverage highlighted that the system completed a variant autonomously in about six hours, while other reports noted that the solved statement was easier than the original conjecture [E124-6H]. Nonetheless this shows its early impact to the math community.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few days later, Harmonic's tool was credited for helping resolve Erdos Problem 1026. A December 14, 2025 write-up described how the AI tool proved a key step $c(k^2)=1/k$ in Lean as part of the eventual solution [E1026-48H]. Harmonic's own news page claims that since Aristotle's public launch in late 2025, mathematicians have used it to formalize proofs across levels and that the company sees this as a new era of discovery. [HN-MSI]\n",
    "\n",
    "For broader context on Erdos problems, the community-maintained erdosproblems GitHub database tracks problem status, prizes, formalizations, and links to related resources. It is essentially a living index of the current state of the problem list and related metadata, with an auto-generated table based on the repository's data files [ERDOS-SOTA]. Top mathematician Prof. Torrence Tao has been pioneering this efforts and other promotion of using AI for math research. The accompanying wiki page on AI contributions is more careful and nuanced: it catalogs where AI tools have been used, but also stresses that this is not a benchmark or leaderboard, that literature review can be incomplete, and that assessments are provisional and context-dependent. The page is best read as a reference for tracing claims and understanding the role AI has actually played [ERDOS-AI].\n",

    "Lean is an interactive theorem prover: humans (or automated tactics) provide the proof steps, and Lean checks every step for correctness. In typical use, the proof is supplied by the user via tactics or proof terms, though automation can discharge many routine goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Lean became popular, prominent proof assistants and formal verification systems included Coq, Isabelle/HOL, HOL Light, ACL2, and Mizar.  Lean was created at Microsoft Research by Leonardo de Moura and collaborators. It began as a general-purpose theorem prover for formal verification and mathematics, and later grew a large community library (mathlib). Rough timeline (high-level): early 2010s initial Lean releases; mid2010s Lean 3 matured and became the main community platform; early 2020s Lean 4 modernized the system and tooling.\n",

The two target identities are reduced to equalities of squared distances, denominators are cleared, and the resulting expressions are simplified by algebraic tactics. In short: the geometry is converted to algebra, and Lean verifies the algebraic identities. This translation indicated the step of converting the informal input description to a format one saving some work from the human.\n",

    "**Note on proof style.** In this problem Aristotle proceeds by a coordinate model, so the proof is essentially algebraic and very similar in spirit to Part 2. That choice is not a rule of Aristotle; it is just the strategy selected for this run. In contrast, Newclid (Part 6) is designed to stay in the geometry domain and produce a synthetic-style trace from diagram constraints. So the key difference to keep in mind is not *correctness* but *style of reasoning and output*: Aristotle outputs a Lean proof (general formal system), while Newclid outputs a geometry-specific derivation. For other problems, Aristotle can also use geometric/angle-chasing reasoning, as seen in the IMO 2025 P2 formalization [IMO2025P2], but here it stayed with coordinates for simplicity.\n",
