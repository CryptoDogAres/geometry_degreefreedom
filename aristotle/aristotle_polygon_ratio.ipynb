    "Harmonic (the company behind Newclid) also has a Lean-based prover called Aristotle that is its closed-source flagship product. The company provides a web interface and API at https://aristotle.harmonic.fun that anyone can register and try (caveat: it can be slow and the job queue can be long). This note uses our small, friendly geometry problem to demonstrate the workflow, while the same system is aimed at harder, cutting-edge problems across mathematics (geometry, number theory, analysis, and more) [ARISTOTLE].\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Aristotle differs from Newclid (short version).** Newclid is a geometry-first system: ew give a diagram-style construction and goals, and its symbolic engine tries to derive a synthetic proof inside that geometry domain. Aristotle is a general Lean prover: it formalizes statements in Lean and then proves them with Lean tactics, so its output is a formal Lean proof rather than a geometry-specific trace. For geometry problems, Aristotle's geometric solver can still use geometric reasoning (which can look Newclid-like), but in this demo it chooses a coordinate model, which looks closer to the analytic approach in Part 2. This is why the artifacts here feel more Lean/coordinate-heavy than Newclid's geometric narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Harmonic reports that Aristotle achieved gold medal-level performance on the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), solving 5 of 6 problems with formally verified solutions [HN-IMO][BW-IMO]. Problem 2 is about pure plane geometry [IMO2025P2]. It is unclear whether the published solution used Newclid-style geometric deduction; the Aristotle paper hints that a separate geometry solver is used, and a Newclid paper appeared shortly afterward. The proof also appears to be a geometric deduction rather than a Lean script.\n",
    "\n",
    "These IMO announcements are a useful backdrop for this demo: we stay with our simple trapezoid ratio to show how Aristotle solves an elementary geometry problem, but the tooling is designed for much harder proofs in domains beyond geometry. Without full information on how Aristotle's geometry engine differs from the open-source Newclid, we focus on how the solutions differ in our small case. The white papers suggest that Aristotle trains an LLM with reinforcement learning to handle highly parallel Monte Carlo graph search over Lean proof states, using policy/value networks to choose nodes and estimate promise. This differs from Newclid's default BFS tree search, which is enhanced by auxiliary-point heuristics when the search gets stuck. That design discussion is beyond the scope of this note. For our simple problem, Aristotle indeed gives a distinct solution relying on Lean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aristotle has been used beyond contest problems. In late 2025, it produced a Lean proof of a simplified variant of Erdos Problem 124. Chinese coverage highlighted that the system completed a variant autonomously in about six hours, while other reports noted that the solved statement was easier than the original conjecture [E124-6H]. Nonetheless, this shows its early impact on the math community.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few days later, Harmonic's tool was credited for helping resolve Erdos Problem 1026. A December 14, 2025 write-up described how the AI tool proved a key step $c(k^2)=1/k$ in Lean as part of the eventual solution [E1026-48H]. Harmonic's own news page claims that since Aristotle's public launch in late 2025, mathematicians have used it to formalize proofs across levels and that the company sees this as a new era of discovery [HN-MSI].\n",
    "\n",
    "For broader context on Erdos problems, the community-maintained erdosproblems GitHub database tracks problem status, prizes, formalizations, and links to related resources. It is essentially a living index of the current state of the problem list and related metadata, with an auto-generated table based on the repository's data files [ERDOS-SOTA]. Top mathematician Prof. Terence Tao has been pioneering this effort and promoting the use of AI for math research. The accompanying wiki page on AI contributions is more careful and nuanced: it catalogs where AI tools have been used, but also stresses that this is not a benchmark or leaderboard, that literature review can be incomplete, and that assessments are provisional and context-dependent. The page is best read as a reference for tracing claims and understanding the role AI has actually played [ERDOS-AI].\n",

Note that the problem text is written in informal plain English, which is accepted by their API as well as the prompt, aside from the alternative Lean input format. Under the hood the model clearly utilizes a strong LLM for understanding such descriptions. In fact, the team has described its solver architecture as a pretrained LLM further trained with reinforcement learning for reasoning [ARISTOTLE].\n",

    "### Lean quick intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Lean is an interactive theorem prover: humans (or automated tactics) provide the proof steps, and Lean checks every step for correctness. In typical use, the proof is supplied by the user via tactics or proof terms, though automation can discharge many routine goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Lean became popular, prominent proof assistants and formal verification systems included Coq, Isabelle/HOL, HOL Light, ACL2, and Mizar.  Lean was created at Microsoft Research by Leonardo de Moura and collaborators. It began as a general-purpose theorem prover for formal verification and mathematics, and later grew a large community library (mathlib). Rough timeline (high-level): early 2010s initial Lean releases; mid-2010s Lean 3 matured and became the main community platform; in the early 2020s Lean 4 modernized the system and tooling.\n",
    "\n",

The two target identities are reduced to equalities of squared distances, denominators are cleared, and the resulting expressions are simplified by algebraic tactics. In short: the geometry is converted to algebra, and Lean verifies the algebraic identities. This highlights the step of converting the informal input description into a formal format, saving some work for the human.\n",

That choice is not a rule of Aristotle; it is just the strategy selected for this run. In contrast, Newclid (Part 6) is designed to stay in the geometry domain and produce a synthetic-style trace from diagram constraints. So the key difference to keep in mind is not *correctness* but *style of reasoning and output*: Aristotle outputs a Lean proof (general formal system), while Newclid outputs a geometry-specific derivation. For other problems, Aristotle can also use geometric/angle-chasing reasoning, as seen in the IMO 2025 P2 formalization [IMO2025P2], but here it stayed with coordinates for simplicity.\n",

    "### Appendix 7A: Introduction of Lean and Aristotle with the Angle Bisector Theorem (understand the output `angle_bisector_problem.lean`)\n",
    "We will use the bisector problem defined in Figure 7.1 as a pilot to give another intro to Lean language and Aristotle. The input statement shown in Figure 7.1 contains a small typo, but it still produced the `angle_bisector_problem.lean` downloade in the `./aristotle` folder. While our focus is to better understand Lean language syntax and its application to this simple problem, Aristotle clearly pivoted quickly to find the typo of the statement. Aristotle's run either hit a wall and then suggested the corrected objective, or its LLM was capable to spot the error right away. In fact since Aristotle has been trained on top of LLM, such correction is fully within its capacity [ARISTOTLE]. However, this still indicates its human-like that's mostly missing from any of the methods mentioned in Part 5 or 6 of the notes. Other than that this appendix summarizes the Lean output and how to read it. Every line of the Lean file is quoted (with line numbers, unchanged content), broken into frequent chunks, with very beginner-friendly commentary—including the deeper explanations of the `exact?` “holes” (what they’re *supposed* to fill, and how to discover the lemma names) without modifying the file. While for a simple bisector theorem this Lean output seems to be an over kill, it nevertheless shows all the necessary logics to deduct the famous output using other known facts (in this case the Law of Sines).\n",

    "#### First: what’s going on here\n",
    "\n",
    "This `.lean` file is a formal proof script. Think of it as:\n",
    "* Theorem statement = a precise claim (a “type” in Lean).\n",
    "* Proof = an object/program that convinces Lean’s kernel the claim is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "So a Lean theorem is like a function:\n",
    "* input: hypotheses (assumptions)\n",
    "* output: the conclusion\n",
    "* body: the proof steps\n",
    "The original request was: AB/AC = AD/DC. The classical Angle Bisector Theorem is: AB/AC = BD/DC. Notice: the conclusion compares how the angle bisector cuts the opposite side BC (that’s BD and DC). Using AD instead is usually false: AD is a “cevian length” that varies in a more complicated way than the side-splitting ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "As show below in the Lean output, Aristotle explicitly *repairs* the statement by replacing AD with BD by the built in language model most likely at certain point of its effort to prove the statement. It is unforunately lack of logging from its API to reveal more details of this critical \"thinking\" step. Yet once the statement is repaired, Lean can proceed with a formal derivation in the rest of the file. The mean Lean library Aristotle uses is MathLib, which contains many theorems [MATHLIB], but the angle bisector theorem isn't one of them; so this suggestion wasn't directly from MathLib database, but more related to the LLM intelligence.\n",
    "\n",

    "* `∧` means “and”.\n",

    "* Lines 17–23 give a human proof outline. That’s already a hint at how these systems work: the agent often chooses a familiar skeleton (Law of Sines) and then Lean forces all the details to be made explicit. In the paper session 2.3.2, it was discussed that Law of sines can be added by its algebraic reasoning engine Yuclid which slows down 10x; so Sine Law is turned off in its recommended configurations [ARISTOTLE].

    "### Appendix 7B: Why `polygon_ratio_problem_aristotle.lean` looks simpler than `angle_bisector_problem.lean`\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the polygon ratio statement is mathematically more elaborate, its Lean development is shorter because it is proved analytically (in coordinates) rather than synthetically (in abstract Euclidean geometry). In Lean, the choice of proof style often dominates file length more than the inherent difficulty of the theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key reasons (from a Lean perspective):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coordinates reduce geometry to algebra.**\n",
    "   In the polygon proof, one fixes a coordinate model (here, the complex plane) and represents points explicitly. Once the configuration is expressed in coordinates, many geometric claims become equalities or inequalities of algebraic expressions (often involving norms). At that stage, Lean’s algebraic automation—`ring`, `nlinarith`, `field_simp`, `norm_num`, and related lemmas—can close goals with comparatively little guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Synthetic Euclidean geometry carries substantial overhead.**\n",
    "   The angle-bisector file works in a coordinate-free setting. As a result, the proof must explicitly manage: nondegeneracy hypotheses (e.g., noncollinearity), collinearity and betweenness predicates, angle definitions and their domain conditions, and the “glue” lemmas that connect these notions. In Lean, these are not merely background facts: they are additional objects and obligations that must be introduced, transported, and rewritten at each step. The resulting script length reflects the *infrastructure* of the framework as much as the theorem itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The polygon proof operates in a normalized model.**\n",
    "   The analytic approach typically proves the claim for a specific normal form—e.g., a parameterized configuration in a fixed coordinate system, with a condition such as `2*a ≠ x` to exclude degenerate cases. Mathematically, this is often justified “up to similarity” (or another equivalence), but the final statement is less general in form than a fully coordinate-free theorem phrased intrinsically in Euclidean geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A useful meta-observation (for exposition):**\n",
    "Analytic proofs often read as longer on paper even when they are shorter in Lean. Human exposition must spell out coordinate choices, compute intermediate quantities, and keep track of case splits that feel mechanical. By contrast, synthetic arguments can cite high-level results (similarity, angle chasing, Menelaus/Ceva, etc.), which compresses the narrative. Formalization reverses this economy: Lean is exceptionally good at compressing algebra once the model is fixed, while synthetic geometry tends to incur higher bookkeeping costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the length difference is largely an artifact of *formalization strategy*: Lean rewards algebraic normalization, whereas synthetic developments pay more overhead for the generality and abstraction they retain.\n"
