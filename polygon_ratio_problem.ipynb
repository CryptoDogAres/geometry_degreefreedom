    "## Introduction\n",
    "During the Christmas holidays, a basic geometry proof problem showed up in my class alumni chat (Figure 1 is the original screenshot from classmate Lin He). He asked about part (2) because part (1) is a warm-up, and that set the whole discussion in motion. I have always liked Euclidean geometry, and problems like this rarely stop at one proof. Draw one line and a ratio drops out; draw another and a different argument appears. What follows is a cleaned collection: one quick sine-law proof, several synthetic proofs, an analytic-geometry proof (from ChatGPT 5.2, edited for clarity), and a one-parameter generalization that reveals deeper structure. I hope it gives younger students a sense of how much structure a single diagram can hide.\n",

    "Question (1) is a warm-up; it follows from similar triangles visible in Figure 3. For part (2), a quick start is the sine law. For a triangle $ABC$ with side lengths $a,b,c$ opposite vertices $A,B,C$, we have\n",

    "Below are brief proof sketches. Each can be completed as a standard middle-school geometry exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 1\n",
    "> Extend $DC$ to $D_1$ so that $D_1$ is symmetric to $D$ with respect to $BC$. Then $\\triangle EBD_1\\sim\\triangle EHD$, so the desired ratio follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 2\n",
    "> Extend $DC$ to $E_2$ so that $E_2$ is symmetric to $E$ with respect to $BC$. Then $\\triangle E_2BD\\sim\\triangle EHD$, so the desired ratio follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 3\n",
    "> From $H$ draw a line parallel to $BE$ and intersect $DE$ at $E'$. Then $HE=HE'$. The rest follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 4\n",
    "> Extend $AE$ to meet $BC$ at $C_4$. Then $AC_4=BD$. Also $\\triangle HED\\sim\\triangle ABC_4$, so the ratio follows. (Credit: Prof. Xueheng Lan.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 4.1\n",
    "> Use the reflection property: the ray from $B$ to $E$ reflects across $DE$ and passes through $H$. This gives the same angle relation at $DE$, so the ratio follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 5\n",
    "> Draw a line from $H$ parallel to $DE$ and intersect $EA$ at $H_5$. Then $DH=EH_5$, and $\\triangle EHH_5\\sim\\triangle BED$, which leads to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 6\n",
    "> Draw a line from $H$ parallel to $BC$ and intersect $DE$ at $H_6$. Then $DH/DB=HH_6/BD=EH/BD$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 7\n",
    "> Draw a line from $H$ parallel to $DE$ and intersect $BE$ at $H_7$. Then $HE:BE=H_7E:BE=HD:BD$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 8\n",
    "> The distances from $D$ to $BE$ and $EH$ are equal (use $DD_8$ and $DD'_8$; these are non-essential since $\\angle BEC=\\angle HED=45^\\circ+\\alpha$). The distances from $E$ to $BD$ and $HD$ are also equal. So area $BDE$ to area $DHE$ can be expressed as $BE\\cdot DD_8/2:EH\\cdot DD'_8/2=BE:EH$, and also as $BD\\cdot GE/2:DH\\cdot GE/2=BD:DH$. Hence they are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 9\n",
    "> Extend $BE$ to $A_9$ where $EA_9=EH$. Then $DH=DA_9$, $EH=EA_9$, and $\\angle EDA_9=\\angle EDH=45^\\circ$. Since $DE$ bisects $\\angle BDA_9$, we get $BD:DA_9=BE:EA_9$. The rest is trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 10\n",
    "> Extend $EH$ to $B_{10}$ where $B_{10}$ intersects the extension of line $BC$. Then $B_{10}$ is the reflection of $B$ across $BC$ (since $HE$ is the reflection path of light $BE$ at mirror $DC$). One can show $\\angle CDB_{10}=\\angle BDC=45^\\circ$, so $DH:HE=DB_{10}:EB_{10}=DB:BE$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 11\n",
    "> This one also needs no auxiliary lines: notice $HD=HG+GE$ and $BD=BG+GE$, and $\\triangle HGE\\sim\\triangle EGB$, so the result follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note on degrees of freedom: the only adjustable angle in the original configuration is $\\alpha<45^\\circ$. If $\\alpha=45^\\circ$, then $H$ and $B$ overlap and the result is trivial. If $\\alpha>45^\\circ$, then $H$ lies on the extension of $DB$, and $E$ lies on the extension of $DC$. The roles of $B$ and $H$ swap, and the same style of arguments still works. Similarly, one can show that a ray from $B$ to $E$ reflects across $DE$ and reaches $H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other proofs\n",
    "By now we should be done. However, if you followed the solutions so far, you likely noticed two patterns: (1) we have essentially drawn a square $BDB_{10}D_1$ in Figure 4, and many proofs are based on various points on this square; (2) polygon $ABED$ is symmetric about $BD$, which is why we could leverage $AB=BE$ and $AH=HE$ in several steps. It follows that any proof obtained by extending lines in the original diagram has a mirror proof across $BD$. These are indicated again by subscripts, and they give Proofs 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16. They form the symmetric rectangle $BDB_{15}D_{12}$ and are shown in Figure 5.\n",

    "</div>\n",

    "\n",
    "The $45^\\circ$ angle is special. If we relax that angle, the clean right-angle structure disappears, but the problem still has a simple geometric core: reflection on an ellipse. The key insight is to generalize the reflection: the ray from $B$ to $E$ reflects across $DE$ and heads to $H$. This reveals an ellipse that reflects light from one focus to the other at any point $E$ on it. That reflection property is equivalent to the constant-sum-of-distances definition of an ellipse.\n",

    "### Construction\n",
    "Let $O$ be the ellipse with foci $B$ and $H$. Take a point $A$ on $O$, with $A$ closer to $H$. Draw the tangent line $AD$ at $A$, and let it intersect $BH$ at $D$. Take a point $E$ on $O$, the reflection of $A$ with respect to the major axis. Through $E$ draw the line $D-E-C$, and choose $C$ so that $BC\\parallel AD$. Draw $EH$, and let it intersect $AB$ at $F$. In general, $\\angle BFE$ is not $90^\\circ$, but when $\\theta=45^\\circ$, $\\angle BFE=90^\\circ$. The resulting shape is shown in Figure 6.\n",

    "In this generalized setup, $EF$ is no longer perpendicular to $AB$. In fact, the perpendicular line intersects $AB$ and $DB$ at $F'$ and $H'$, as shown in Figure 7. Here $H'$ differs from $H$ and does not satisfy the ratio property. The original problem is special because the $45^\\circ$ angles create a surplus of right angles.

    "Once one length is fixed, the trapezoid configuration has a single degree of freedom: the angle $\\alpha$. In the broader ellipse construction, a second parameter $\\theta$ (the tangent point/slope) appears, and the same ratio follows from the reflection property. The special case $\\theta=45^\\circ$ is exactly the original problem; that is why so many proofs exist, and why each auxiliary line exposes the same invariant ratio in a different way. Part 3 frees the $\\theta$ dimension while keeping the reflection property, and that is what ultimately shows the simplicity behind the original picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This arc also mirrors the historical split between geometry and algebra in physics and mechanics. Newton, in the *Principia* [3], favored coordinate-free arguments because they were the clearest language of rigor in 1687, while modern physics often relies on coordinates for universal computation. The conclusions, however, are invariant, and the geometric viewpoint keeps that symmetry visible. Several later authors also gave elementary, coordinate-free proofs (see [2]). It is good for young students to appreciate both techniques.\n",

    "The concept of vector analysis has evolved significantly since Newton's time, and that evolution echoes the flavor of Part 1 in these notes. While we did not use the differential side of geometry here, Newton's proofs of planetary motion combined geometric constructions, similarity with auxiliary lines, and infinitesimal limiting arguments (see [3] and [2]). Much later, Maxwell's equations were first written in a coordinate-expanded form, which has the flavor of our solution in Part 2, along with differential operators that were by then well understood. Only later did divergence and curl become standard, giving a more compact, coordinate-free expression of Maxwell's equations using $\\nabla\\cdot$ and $\\nabla\\times$. Those operators are coordinate-free in meaning, which parallels the shift from the coordinate solution in Part 2 to the coordinate-free constructions in Part 1, but with greater power. Vector analysis keeps the geometric insight while still enabling the algebraic computations of the coordinate approach. To explain the power of this toolbox, I include a couple of short proofs below.\n",

    "It is noteworthy that the mathematical techniques developed further into geometric algebra, which combines vectors and bivectors (no longer purely vectors), and later into differential forms that skip vectors altogether. Our proofs below can use the cross product in vector analysis, or use the geometric-algebra bivector concept equivalently (they carry the same information when the geometry is 2D Euclidean, as in our case). We will focus on the vector-analysis form in the following. Here we want to emphasize how these more advanced tools enable coordinate-free proofs while still allowing more advanced analytic methods than the purely ancient Euclidean geometry used in Part 1.\n",

More generally, one can start from essentially any point in the diagram, parameterize the remaining configuration by a small set of length (or scaling) parameters, and then drive the argument to the target length-ratio identity. There are many such routes, and most do not require introducing any auxiliary lines.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the present 2D Euclidean setting, the geometric-algebra approach does not introduce much additional structure. The wedge product $\\wedge$ carries essentially the same geometric information as the (embedded) cross product: both encode the oriented (signed) area of the parallelogram spanned by two vectors. Likewise, the differential-forms formulation is not fundamentally different in this context: a 2-form takes two vectors as input and returns a scalar, so the resulting identities reduce to the same area or determinant computations already used in the cross-product argument (e.g., Proof 4.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the forms and geometric-algebra reconstructions in our problem are largely transferable, and, at least in this 2D case, do not change the essential mechanism of the proof. If a genuinely distinct use of these frameworks becomes useful later (for example, one that clarifies higher-dimensional generalizations or invariant structure), it can be added as an optional extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "To emphasize the common backbone: Proof 8 is driven by area ratios. The relevant area can be represented equivalently as (i) the determinant of the two side vectors of a triangle, (ii) the magnitude of their (embedded) cross product, (iii) the magnitude of their wedge product, or (iv) the evaluation of the canonical area 2-form on the same pair of vectors. These are simply different notational realizations of the same underlying invariant. In this sense, Proof 4.2 and Proof 8 are exploiting the same area-ratio principle, expressed through slightly different languages.\n",
