    "## Introduction\n",
    "During the Christmas holidays, a basic geometry proof problem showed up in my class alumni chat (Figure 1 is the original screenshot from classmate Lin He). He asked about part (2) because part (1) is a warm-up, and that set the whole discussion in motion. I have always liked Euclidean geometry, and problems like this rarely stop at one proof. Draw one line and a ratio drops out; draw another and a different argument appears. What follows is a cleaned collection: one quick sine-law proof, several synthetic proofs, an analytic-geometry proof (from ChatGPT 5.2, edited for clarity), and a one-parameter generalization that reveals deeper structure. I hope it gives younger students a sense of how much structure a single diagram can hide.\n",

    "Below are brief proof sketches. Each can be completed as a standard middle-school geometry exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 1\n",
    "> Extend $DC$ to $D_1$ so that $D_1$ is symmetric to $D$ with respect to $BC$. Then $\\triangle EBD_1\\sim\\triangle EHD$, so the desired ratio follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 2\n",
    "> Extend $DC$ to $E_2$ so that $E_2$ is symmetric to $E$ with respect to $BC$. Then $\\triangle E_2BD\\sim\\triangle EHD$, so the desired ratio follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 3\n",
    "> From $H$ draw a line parallel to $BE$ and intersect $DE$ at $E'$. Then $HE=HE'$. The rest follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 4\n",
    "> Extend $AE$ to meet $BC$ at $C_4$. Then $AC_4=BD$. Also $\\triangle HED\\sim\\triangle ABC_4$, so the ratio follows. (Credit: Prof. Xueheng Lan.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 4.1\n",
    "> Use the reflection property: the ray from $B$ to $E$ reflects across $DE$ and passes through $H$. This gives the same angle relation at $DE$, so the ratio follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 5\n",
    "> Draw a line from $H$ parallel to $DE$ and intersect $EA$ at $H_5$. Then $DH=EH_5$, and $\\triangle EHH_5\\sim\\triangle BED$, which leads to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 6\n",
    "> Draw a line from $H$ parallel to $BC$ and intersect $DE$ at $H_6$. Then $DH/DB=HH_6/BD=EH/BD$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 7\n",
    "> Draw a line from $H$ parallel to $DE$ and intersect $BE$ at $H_7$. Then $HE:BE=H_7E:BE=HD:BD$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 8\n",
    "> The distances from $D$ to $BE$ and $EH$ are equal (use $DD_8$ and $DD'_8$; these are non-essential since $\\angle BEC=\\angle HED=45^\\circ+\\alpha$). The distances from $E$ to $BD$ and $HD$ are also equal. So area $BDE$ to area $DHE$ can be expressed as $BE\\cdot DD_8/2:EH\\cdot DD'_8/2=BE:EH$, and also as $BD\\cdot GE/2:DH\\cdot GE/2=BD:DH$. Hence they are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 9\n",
    "> Extend $BE$ to $A_9$ where $EA_9=EH$. Then $DH=DA_9$, $EH=EA_9$, and $\\angle EDA_9=\\angle EDH=45^\\circ$. Since $DE$ bisects $\\angle BDA_9$, we get $BD:DA_9=BE:EA_9$. The rest is trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 10\n",
    "> Extend $EH$ to $B_{10}$ where $B_{10}$ intersects the extension of line $BC$. Then $B_{10}$ is the reflection of $B$ across $BC$ (since $HE$ is the reflection path of light $BE$ at mirror $DC$). One can show $\\angle CDB_{10}=\\angle BDC=45^\\circ$, so $DH:HE=DB_{10}:EB_{10}=DB:BE$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 11\n",
    "> This one also needs no auxiliary lines: notice $HD=HG+GE$ and $BD=BG+GE$, and $\\triangle HGE\\sim\\triangle EGB$, so the result follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note on degrees of freedom: the only adjustable angle in the original configuration is $\\alpha<45^\\circ$. If $\\alpha=45^\\circ$, then $H$ and $B$ overlap and the result is trivial. If $\\alpha>45^\\circ$, then $H$ lies on the extension of $DB$, and $E$ lies on the extension of $DC$. The roles of $B$ and $H$ swap, and the same style of arguments still works. Similarly, one can show that a ray from $B$ to $E$ reflects across $DE$ and reaches $H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other proofs\n",
    "By now we should be done. However, if you followed the solutions so far, you likely noticed two patterns: (1) we have essentially drawn a square $BDB_{10}D_1$ in Figure 4, and many proofs are based on various points on this square; (2) polygon $ABED$ is symmetric about $BD$, which is why we could leverage $AB=BE$ and $AH=HE$ in several steps. It follows that any proof obtained by extending lines in the original diagram has a mirror proof across $BD$. These are indicated again by subscripts, and they give Proofs 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16. They form the symmetric rectangle $BDB_{15}D_{12}$ and are shown in Figure 5.\n",

    "\n",
    "The $45^\\circ$ angle is special. If we relax that angle, the clean right-angle structure disappears, but the problem still has a simple geometric core: reflection on an ellipse. The key insight is to generalize the reflection: the ray from $B$ to $E$ reflects across $DE$ and heads to $H$. This reveals an ellipse that reflects light from one focus to the other at any point $E$ on it. That reflection property is equivalent to the constant-sum-of-distances definition of an ellipse.\n",

    "Let $O$ be the ellipse with foci $B$ and $H$. Take a point $A$ on $O$, with $A$ closer to $H$. Draw the tangent line $AD$ at $A$, and let it intersect $BH$ at $D$. Take a point $E$ on $O$, the reflection of $A$ with respect to the major axis. Through $E$ draw the line $D-E-C$, and choose $C$ so that $BC\\parallel AD$. Draw $EH$, and let it intersect $AB$ at $F$. In general, $\\angle BFE$ is not $90^\\circ$, but when $\\theta=45^\\circ$, $\\angle BFE=90^\\circ$. The resulting shape is shown in Figure 6.\n",

    "In this generalized setup, $EF$ is no longer perpendicular to $AB$. In fact, the perpendicular line through $E$ intersects $AB$ and $DB$ at $F'$ and $H'$, as shown in Figure 7. Here $H'$ differs from $H$ and does not satisfy the ratio property. The original problem is special because the $45^\\circ$ angles create a surplus of right angles. The single degree of freedom here is essentially the ellipse eccentricity, with $A$ and $C$ determined by the right angle $\\angle ADC$. When the ellipse degenerates to a circle (foci coincide), the identity becomes obvious.\n",

Since only $y$ is scaled, $E$ and $E'$ lie on a line perpendicular to $BH$ and share the same $x$-coordinate. Let $E''$ be the intersection of the line through $E$ parallel to $BH$ with the outer circle, so $E$ and $E''$ share the same $y$-coordinate (Figure 9).

    "\n",
    "### Corollary 2 (focus-to-outer-tangent distances)\n",
    "> Corollary 1 gives $EH=DH\\cos\\beta$, and geometrically $DH\\cos\\beta$ is exactly the perpendicular component of $DH$ to $\\ell'$, i.e., $\\operatorname{dist}(H,\\ell')$ (see Figure 9). Hence\n",

    "### Proof 3.4 Outer circle proof\n",
    ">Once Corollary 2 is in hand, let $P$ and $P'$ be the feet of the perpendiculars from $H$ and $B$ to $\\ell'$ (for simplicity Figure 9 only shows $P$). Then $\\triangle DHP \\sim \\triangle DBP'$ (right angles at $P,P'$ and a common angle at $D$), so $DH/DB=HP/BP'=\\operatorname{dist}(H,\\ell')/\\operatorname{dist}(B,\\ell')$, recovering the same ratio.\n",

    "Finally, there is a fun fact. Note that the feet of the perpendiculars drawn in Proof 3.2, $S$ and $T$, are exactly the intersection points of the tangent line $DE$ with the ellipse's outer circle. A quick proof is to show that $OT=a$ (Figure 10). Let $H'$ be the reflection of $H$ across $DE$; then $T$ is the midpoint of $HH'$. Since $O$ is the midpoint of $BH$, we have $OT=\\tfrac{1}{2}BH'$. But $BH'=BE+EH=2a$, hence $OT=a$. The same reflection with $B$ gives $OS=a$, so the fun fact is that $S$ and $T$ are precisely the two intersections of $DE$ with the outer circle. \n",

    "### Part 4. Vector analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Once one length is fixed, the trapezoid configuration has a single degree of freedom: the angle $\\alpha$. In the broader ellipse construction, a second parameter $\\theta$ (the tangent point/slope) appears, and the same ratio follows from the reflection property. The special case $\\theta=45^\\circ$ is exactly the original problem; that is why so many proofs exist, and why each auxiliary line exposes the same invariant ratio in a different way. Part 3 frees the $\\theta$ dimension while keeping the reflection property, and that is what ultimately shows the simplicity behind the original picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Part of the note, we will focusing on using some other mathematical tools useful in geometry to solve our proof. The problem to proof is almost trivial: DH:DB = EH:EB, given light BE reflects to the EH direction by mirror DE. Part 3 has explained extensively of the solutions. But it is still good to show some of the power of such tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Euclid (~300 BCE), geometry was developed in a synthetic style: one reasons directly with the figure using congruence, similarity, tangency, and auxiliary lines. That is the mindset behind Part 1. A major second language arrived with Descartes (1637): analytic geometry turns geometric constraints into algebra once you choose coordinates, matching the style of Part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "This arc also mirrors the historical split between geometry and algebra in physics and mechanics. Newton, in the *Principia* [3], favored coordinate-free arguments because they were the clearest language of rigor in 1687, while modern physics often relies on coordinates for universal computation. Analytic geometry existed by Newton's time, but the algebraic language for differential equations matured later; Newton's methods therefore look Euclidean in flavor, mixing auxiliary lines with limiting arguments. Several later authors also gave elementary, coordinate-free proofs (see [2], including Feynman's famous \"lost lecture\"). It is good for students to appreciate both techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics naturally blends geometry with differential ideas. Here we keep that discussion light and focus on the geometric tools that sit just below calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1800s, geometry gained an especially efficient algebraic interface: vector analysis, where the dot and cross products encode the two most basic geometric primitives--projection/angle and oriented area. The modern $\\cdot$ and $\\times$ notation was introduced by Gibbs (and independently Heaviside) around 1881 and then standardized in physics usage. Later, divergence and curl became standard because they compactly describe fields and their integral laws--but that differential layer is not our focus here.\n",
    "\n",
    "That same \"area backbone\" explains the next conceptual step. Grassmann (1844) introduced the wedge product and exterior algebra, where the fundamental geometric object is no longer just a vector but also a bivector (directed area), trivector (directed volume), and so on. Clifford (1878) then built geometric algebra by unifying these objects into one coherent multiplication system. In our 2D Euclidean setting,\n",
    "$$|\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{t}|,\\qquad \\|\\mathbf{u}\\wedge\\mathbf{t}\\|,\\qquad |\\omega(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{t})|$$\n",
    "are simply three notations for the same invariant: the area spanned by $\\mathbf{u}$ and the tangent direction $\\mathbf{t}$. So the proofs are interchangeable across these languages with no change in geometric content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, modern physics is \"geometric\" in a deeper sense: it naturally lives on spaces that are not just 2D pictures--3D space, 4D spacetime, and even higher-dimensional configuration/phase spaces. We don't always call those \"geometry\" in everyday language because they're hard to visualize, but mathematically they are geometry: they carry intrinsic notions of angle, area/flux, invariance, and coordinate-free meaning. In our ellipse problem, we see a toy version of the same idea: at each point $E$ on the ellipse, there is a tangent line $DE$. Thinking of the tangent line as the attached object that moves with $E$ is the simplest concrete example of the bundle/fiber mindset.\n",

    "So the concept of vector analysis has evolved significantly since Newton's time. Maxwell's equations were first written in a coordinate-expanded form, which has the flavor of our solution in Part 2, along with differential operators that were by then well understood. Only later did divergence and curl become standard, giving a more compact, coordinate-free expression using $\\nabla\\cdot$ and $\\nabla\\times$. Those operators are coordinate-free in meaning, which parallels the shift from the coordinate solution in Part 2 back to the coordinate-free constructions in Part 1. Vector analysis keeps the geometric insight while still enabling the algebraic computations of the coordinate approach. To explain the power of this toolbox, I include a couple of short proofs below.\n",

    "> Hence $$\\overrightarrow{ED}=\\tau(\\hat u-\\hat v)$$ for some scalar $\\tau$.\n",
    "> Because $D\\in BH$, $$\\overrightarrow{BH}=\\overrightarrow{EH}-\\overrightarrow{EB}=q\\hat v-p\\hat u,\\quad \\overrightarrow{BD}=\\mu\\overrightarrow{BH}.$$\n",
    "> Using $\\overrightarrow{ED}=\\overrightarrow{EB}+\\overrightarrow{BD}$ gives $$\\tau(\\hat u-\\hat v)=p(1-\\mu)\\hat u+\\mu q\\hat v.$$\n",
    "> Matching coefficients yields $\\tau=p(1-\\mu)$ and $-\\tau=\\mu q$, so $\\mu=\\frac{p}{p-q}$.\n",
    "> Finally, $\\overrightarrow{HD}=\\overrightarrow{BD}-\\overrightarrow{BH}=(\\mu-1)\\overrightarrow{BH}$, so $$\\frac{BD}{HD}=\\frac{\\mu}{\\mu-1}=\\frac{p}{q}=\\frac{BE}{EH},$$ which is equivalent to $\\frac{BE}{BD}=\\frac{EH}{HD}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof 4.2 (using the cross product)\n",
    "> Let the tangent at $E$ meet $BH$ at $D$, and take any nonzero tangent vector $\\overrightarrow{ED}$. The reflection law says the tangent bisects the angle between $\\overrightarrow{EB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{EH}$, so the perpendicular components match:\n",
    "> $$\\frac{|\\overrightarrow{EH}\\times\\overrightarrow{ED}|}{EH}=\\frac{|\\overrightarrow{EB}\\times\\overrightarrow{ED}|}{EB}.$$\n",

    "\\overrightarrow{AB}=0$. This orthogonality can be used to reduce the degrees of freedom without appealing to any reflection argument. More generally, one can start from essentially any point in the diagram, parameterize the remaining configuration by a small set of length (or scaling) parameters, and then drive the argument to the target length-ratio identity. There are many such routes, and they do not require introducing any auxiliary lines.\n",

    "In this 2D Euclidean setting, the geometric-algebra approach does not introduce additional structure compare with the cross product. Both encode the oriented (signed) area of the parallelogram spanned by two vectors. The $\\times$ only makes traditional sense in 3D space, resulting in a vector perpendicular to the plane, the $\\wedge$ operator gives a bivector that's definited universally for d-D space and the bivector doesn't need to utilize the 3rd dimension. Likewise, the differential-forms formulation is not fundamentally different in this context: a 2-form takes two vectors as input and returns a scalar, and 1-form vector is essentially difine the dot product of any vector with a given vector; so the resulting identities reduce to the same area or determinant computations already used in the cross-product argument. For completeness, Proof 4.3 shows how they are united and replaced in the same proof. Be aware that in the modern math/physics which often utilize dimensionality beyond 3, the dot and cross way become hard, which is way we had to separate time t (another dimension strictly speaking) from the space in order to write the equation as \"coordinate free\". And that's why you no longer see any use of t in the unified maxell equation using geometric algebra and differential form.\n",
