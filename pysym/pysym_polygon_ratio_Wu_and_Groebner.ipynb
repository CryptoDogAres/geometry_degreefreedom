    "## Part 5: Groebner and Wu: polynomial elimination methods\n",
    "So far, in Parts 1–4, we’ve followed a mostly pure-math storyline: from Euclid’s synthetic geometry, through analytic and algebraic viewpoints, all the way to the modern language of vectors, forms, and (eventually) geometric algebra—ideas that were already in very solid shape by the early 20th century. A natural next question is: what happened in roughly the last 50 years for solving Euclidean geometry problems? The surprise is that the “next big step” is not a new axiom system, but a new attitude: turn geometry into an algorithm—a replicable, programmable procedure for symbolic reasoning. In Euclidean geometry this becomes especially concrete: translate points, lines, circles, and incidences into variables, and translate geometric constraints into polynomial equations. Once everything becomes polynomial, a proof turns into a computable elimination problem. In this part we introduce two early but seminal algebraic approaches to automated Euclidean theorem proving: Wu’s method (first) and the Gröbner basis method (second).\n",

    "Wu’s method (Wen-Tsün / Wenjun Wu, late 1970s). Wu’s method—often presented through characteristic sets (triangular-style elimination)—was developed by Wen-Tsün Wu in the late 1970s and became one of the first highly successful, systematic methods for mechanical theorem proving in elementary geometry [WU-ORIG] [WU-CHAR]. The key move is explicitly analytic: choose coordinates for “free” points, convert each geometric relation (collinearity, perpendicularity, equal lengths, parallelism, cyclicity, etc.) into polynomial constraints, then eliminate variables in a structured way until the target statement reduces to an algebraic consequence of the hypotheses [WU-CHAR]. Conceptually it’s: geometry → polynomials → elimination, with a procedure that a computer can execute step-by-step.\n",

Wu emphasized this as a workable philosophy of mechanization—geometry carries enough intrinsic structure that, after coordinatization, proof becomes a deterministic computation [WU-SURVEY].

    "This is Wu-flavored code, but it does not implement the full, original Wu characteristic-set algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real Wu method, you fix a variable order (a precedence like $h_y \\succ h_x \\succ \\cdots$), then build a triangular chain (a characteristic set).\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not \"randomly solve\" for a variable when it looks convenient. You pick eliminations to make the next polynomial's main variable well-behaved and the chain triangular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly: Wu's method avoids fraction of polynomials by using pseudo-division (a.k.a. pseudo-remainder).\n",
    "This guarantees you stay inside the polynomial ring: no denominators ever appear.\n",
    "Internally, pseudo-division multiplies by powers of the leading coefficient, so the \"portfolio\" always contains pure polynomials.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we call it \"Wu-style\" elimination here: same spirit (triangular elimination), but the first version uses solve (which may introduce denominators), while the second version shows the truly programmable \"no-denominator\" elimination that resembles Wu's mechanics. Below we will show how the problem would be solved had we followed the algo of Wu's method more programmably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully programmable \"no-denominator\" Wu-like elimination (pseudo-remainder)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the key upgrade: we eliminate variables without ever dividing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core idea (one line)\n",
    "\n",
    "To eliminate $h_y$, we replace \"substitute $h_y=-b/a$\" by pseudo-remainder:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_2 = \\operatorname{prem}(f_2, f_1; h_y),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which equals $a^k f_2(h_y=-b/a)$ but with denominators cleared, hence still a polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this corresponds to mathematically\n",
    "\n",
    "We built a triangular chain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_1 = f_1 \\quad \\text{(main variable } h_y),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_2 = \\operatorname{prem}(f_2, T_1; h_y) \\quad \\text{(main variable } h_x).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we reduced the goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p \\xrightarrow{\\operatorname{prem}(\\cdot, T_1; h_y)} R_p \\xrightarrow{\\operatorname{prem}(\\cdot, T_2; h_x)} 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is exactly the \"eliminate $h_y$, then eliminate $h_x$, then the goal collapses\" story - but now in a Wu-programmable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important Wu caveat (geometry degeneracy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo-division implicitly assumes the leading coefficients used during elimination are not zero (otherwise the \"main variable\" disappears and you're in a degenerate case).\n",
    "In geometry, this corresponds to \"generic position\" assumptions (no coincident points, no accidental parallel collapse, etc.).\n"

    "Both are algebraic proof engines for Euclidean geometry. You can view them as part of the late-20th-century symbolic-computation wave - systems like Mathematica and Maple made it natural to treat a proof as exact symbolic computation rather than numerical approximation [CAS-GEN]. In the same spirit, more specialized tools target narrower domains: CAS for polynomial ideals, theorem provers for logic and rewriting, and geometry-specific solvers that package the translation \"geometry -> equations\" into a push-button workflow [ATP-GEO].\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, what makes Wu’s method and Gröbner bases so powerful is that they follow a predefined algorithm: a fixed list of steps and inference rules that can be written down both in English and in code. You don’t “invent” auxiliary lines, clever constructions, or human-style insights; instead, you encode the entire diagram as algebra, and then let the algorithm grind through elimination and reduction until the conclusion becomes inevitable. In that sense, no extra lines are needed because there is no geometric search for a helpful picture—everything is already inside the polynomial system. The engine is *algebraic to the bone*: points become variables, relations become polynomial constraints, and the proof becomes a statement like “this polynomial reduces to zero under these generators,” obtained by a completely reproducible procedure [WU-CHAR] [GB-HIST].\n",
